I"«<p>Lately, Iâ€™ve been getting involved with some sketchy stuff. You know what Iâ€™m talking aboutâ€“data migrations.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been rolling out changes that have a significant risk of breaking our production environment for mission-critical services. Itâ€™s been exciting work (keep your eyes out for more posts on the exact project, coming soonâ„¢ï¸), but Iâ€™ve definitely caused a couple incidents along the way.</p>

<p>After accidentally taking down a key service for a couple hours, I decided I needed to have a better pre-deploy process for these changes. I did some thinking and came up with a short checklist to run through before I press the shiny green button.</p>
