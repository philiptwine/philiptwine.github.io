        <h1>The Transformative Power of Simple Questions</h1>
<p>When trying to change team or an individual’s behaviour, use simple, distilled questions.</p>
<p>A well-crafted, repeated question will communicate the change, provide focus, and add some healthy pressure.</p>
<p>This causes the receiver(s) to re-evaluate, re-work (if needed), and take ownership. Happily, this question preserves (and even enhances) the receiver’s autonomy and responsibility.</p>
<p>In contrast, other tools, such as checklists and process flow diagrams introduce rigidity, maintenance overhead, and a sense of compliance, leading to disempowerment.</p>
<h2>Example simple questions</h2>
<h3>“What did you learn ... [e.g. about users, feature performance, subject area etc.]?”</h3>
<p>Emphasises the importance of discovery, synthesis, and open-minded exploration.</p>
<h3>“Are you happy with ... [e.g. this design]?”</h3>
<p>Encourages individual and collective responsibility, emphasising quality, ownership, and the opportunity for course correction.</p>
<h3>“Have you tested for ... [e.g. speed/accessibility/etc.]?”</h3>
<p>Highlights a specific, previously overlooked factor, and communicates its importance.</p>
<h2>Crafting simple questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Understand the goals and challenges of the business/team/individual.</li>
<li>Identify the core issue.</li>
<li>Assess the current state and define the desired state — this gap forms the core of your question.</li>
<li>Draft a simple, clear, empathetic, and forward-looking, closed-format question.</li>
<li>Test, refine, and ask your question.</li>
<li>Follow up with supportive actions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be prepared to repeat the question multiple times. Persistence, understanding, and patience should be your default settings.</p>
