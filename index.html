      <h1>Another blog?</h1>
<p>Yep, I'm throwing my hat in the ring, and sharing things I've learnt throughout my career in design.</p>
<p>But who am I and what's my authority?</p>
<p>Well, to the second part &quot;None, I have no authority&quot;.</p>
<p>What I do have is a ton of experience from 20+ years working in research and design, and at a wide variety of companies, big and small.</p>
<p>I've designed apps for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/dominos-pizza-delivery/id426415753" title="Domino's Pizza app store page">Domino's Pizza</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/lner-train-times-tickets/id1521840052" title="LNER app store page">various</a> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/first-bus/id566586379" title="First Bus app store page">transportation</a> companies, <a href="https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en" title="Money Helper website">UK government agencies</a>, and <a href="https://www.antidote.me" title="Antidote.me homepage">startups</a>. I've built and managed research and design teams. Oh, and I've also formed my own software startups (with the scars to prove it).</p>
<p>Now, I lead research and design at <a href="http://www.workflowy.com" title="Workflowy home page">Workflowy</a>, a productivity tool that helps people collect, organise, and turn their ideas into reality.</p>
<p>So, you can expect me to write about the macro and micro of designing software, from product strategy and design processes, all the way down to nerding out about keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>I'll also share tools/techniques that I've created along the way, hoping that if I save one person five minutes then it'll have been worth it.</p>
<p>Anyway, until next time, onwards.</p>
