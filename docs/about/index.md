I’ve always loved figuring out how things work, how people use them, and how to make them better.

My dad was a printer and when computers transformed his industry, I helped him layout and design work ready for printing.
When it came time to choose a career, I thought it was the computer bit of the process that I was most interested in, leading me to university to study Computer Science.

Several years later, as I was about to sit my Java exams, I had a change of heart and, having been designing as a hobby, switched careers.

The years of coding has helped massively when it comes to design. My philosophy has always been that if you don’t understand how a tool works, you can never get the most out of it.

Now, I lead and manage digital product design teams to create exceptional user-centered mobile and web experiences that drive business value.

I'm also partial to a good cup of tea.
