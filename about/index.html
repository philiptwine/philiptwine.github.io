			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I’ve always loved figuring out how things work, how people use them, and how to make them better.</p>

<p>My dad was a printer and when computers transformed his industry, I helped him layout and design work ready for printing.
When it came time to choose a career, I thought it was the computer bit of the process that I was most interested in, leading me to university to study Computer Science.</p>

<p>Several years later, as I was about to sit my Java exams, I had a change of heart and, having been designing as a hobby, switched careers.</p>

<p>The years of coding has helped massively when it comes to design. My philosophy has always been that if you don’t understand how a tool works, you can never get the most out of it.</p>

<p>Now, I lead and manage digital product design teams to create exceptional user-centered mobile and web experiences that drive business value.</p>

<p>I’ve worked in startups (including my own), in-house teams, and agencies.</p>

<p>I am an advocate of User-centred Design, Lean and Agile methodologies, with a focus always on the end user.</p>

<p>I believe in rapidly prototyping ideas, learning from users, learning from the data and improving the original solution.</p>

<p>The knowledge I’ve gained whilst working in such a variety of companies has made me an excellent self-motivator, allowed me to manage others, and has given me a deep understanding of creativity and technology.</p>

<p>I’m also partial to a good cup of tea.</p>

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philiptwine/">LinkedIn</a>. and <a href="https://twitter.com/philiptwine">Twitter</a></p>
