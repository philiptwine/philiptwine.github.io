# Use Simple Questions to Empower People
Simple questions are one of my two most effective tools for helping people. (The other is show, don’t tell.)

A well-crafted, repeated question will communicate the change, provide focus, and add some healthy pressure. This causes the receiver(s) to pause, and rework (if needed), whilst retaining autonomy and responsibility.

In contrast, telling people what to do or providing rigid systems (checklists and process flow diagrams) leads to disempowerment.

## Some Questions I Regularly Use

### “What did you learn … [e.g. about users, feature performance, subject area etc.]?”
This emphasises the importance of discovery, synthesis, and open-minded exploration.

### “Are you happy with … [e.g. this design]?”

This encourages individual and team responsibility, emphasising quality and ownership. “Tell me why you’re happy with it?” is a great follow-up, to understand intent.

### “Have you tested for … [e.g. speed/accessibility/etc.]?”

This highlights a specific, previously overlooked factor, and communicates its importance.

## Crafting Simple Questions

- Identify the core issue by talking to the individual/team.
- Assess the current state and define the desired state — this gap forms the core of your question.
- Draft and ask your question.
- Follow up with supportive actions.

Be prepared to repeat the question several times. Persistence, understanding, and patience should be your default settings.
