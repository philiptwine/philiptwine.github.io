# The Transformative Power of Simple Questions
When trying to change team or an individual’s behaviour, use simple, distilled questions.

A well-crafted, repeated question will communicate the change, provide focus, and add some healthy pressure.

This causes the receiver(s) to re-evaluate, re-work (if needed), and take ownership. Happily, this question preserves (and even enhances) the receiver’s autonomy and responsibility.

In contrast, other tools, such as checklists and process flow diagrams introduce rigidity, maintenance overhead, and a sense of compliance, leading to disempowerment.

## Example simple questions
### “What did you learn ... [e.g. about users, feature performance, subject area etc.]?”
Emphasises the importance of discovery, synthesis, and open-minded exploration.

### “Are you happy with ... [e.g. this design]?”
Encourages individual and collective responsibility, emphasising quality, ownership, and the opportunity for course correction.

### “Have you tested for ... [e.g. speed/accessibility/etc.]?”
Highlights a specific, previously overlooked factor, and communicates its importance.

## Crafting simple questions

- Understand the goals and challenges of the business/team/individual.
- Identify the core issue.
- Assess the current state and define the desired state — this gap forms the core of your question.
- Draft a simple, clear, empathetic, and forward-looking, closed-format question.
- Test, refine, and ask your question.
- Follow up with supportive actions.

Be prepared to repeat the question multiple times. Persistence, understanding, and patience should be your default settings.
